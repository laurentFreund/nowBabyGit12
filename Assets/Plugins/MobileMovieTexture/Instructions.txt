Mobile Movie Texture 1.1.1

Installing the plugin
	Please move the Plugins directory from here Assets/MobileMovieTexture/Plugins to be in the root Assets/ directory
	Also move the StreamingAssets directory movies in Assets/MobileMovieTexture/StreamingAssets to be in the root Assets/ directory

	At this point, you might want to try the sample scene MobileMovieTexture/Scenes/MobileMovieTextureTest.unity 

	Press play and you should see a video play on the plane in the scene.

Encoding new movies
	Mobile Movie Texture only supports ogg theora encoded videos. The easiest way to encode ogg theora is to use http://v2v.cc/~j/ffmpeg2theora/download.html or VLC http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ .

Starting from scratch
	Firstly you will need a material to play the movie on. Create a new material
	Set your new material's shader to "Color Space/YCrCbtoRGB"

	Next add the MobileMovieTexture/Scripts/MobileMovieTexture.cs to an active game object in the scene
	The path string field in MobileMovieTexture points to your movie within the StreamingAssets/ directory without the "StreamingAssets/" on the start of it. Always use forward slashes if you need your movie in a sub directory. Forward slashes work on all platforms.

	Now apply the material you created to an object in the scene.

	That should be it

Changes
	Version 1.1.1 28/12/2011
	iOS/Android: Work around a texture allocation bug in Unity if nothing else is drawing in the sample scene, by drawing a gui button
	
	Version 1.1 27/12/2011
	All: platforms now do color space conversion on the gpu. This resulted in a 2x performance increase in iOS and a 1.7x in Android, in my tests.
	All: There is a big memory saving from not storing the converted 16bit rgb in ram. For example for the test movies, we saved NextPow2(640) * NextPow2(360) * 2 bytes = 1Mb
	Android: now has cpu features detection and uses NEON instructions where available. iOS always uses NEON.
	Windows/OSX: use power of 2 YCrCb textures for a massive speed up.
	Windows/OSX: use SetPixels32 for another speed up.
	All: Removing the color space conversion code saved ~10k
	Android: Fixed a bug on when resuming
	Windows/OSX: Hand code the YCrCb shader to work around bad cgsl compilation by Unity
	
	Known issues
	Android: There is an intermittent crash in the Adreno 200 OpenGL driver on my Nexus one, it crashes deep within the Areno driver in my call to glTexSubImage2D, in rb_texture_find_eviction_candidate in __memcmp16. I will do everything I can to find a solution or a workaround
